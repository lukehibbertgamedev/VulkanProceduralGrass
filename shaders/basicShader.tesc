// Tessellation Control Shader

// A quad is used as the base geometry for the representation of a grass blade.
// This stage is used to calculate the tessellation levels, representing the number of segments the quad is divided into.
// The number of segments represents the level of smoothness of the final blade.
// Tessellation will be proportional to the distance from the camera.
