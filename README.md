# Procedural Grass in Vulkan

## Information

Procedural geometry aims to utilise graphical processing unit advancements in an attempt to visually outperform the common and reliable approach by representing individual grass blades as BÃ©zier curves. This results in a technique that is more advanced and allows grass to feel more dynamic by adapting to natural environmental effects or player interaction. This project tests the claim that using a low-level API to manipulate graphical processing unit drivers in a way that improves the overall generation, rendering, and animation of grass blades within an immersive environment when compared to other, standard APIs.  

This project is inspried by Klemens Jahrmann and Michael Wimmer with their Interactive Grass Rendering Using Real-Time Tessellation (Jahrmann & Wimmer, 2017).

## Installation

**Note**: This project is only supported on Windows.

Clone the repository using ```git clone --recurse-submodules github.com/lukehibbertgamedev/VulkanProceduralGrass.git```.

Run ```generate_vs.bat```, this will unpack and build CMake, then generate a Visual Studio 2022 solution within build_x64/.
